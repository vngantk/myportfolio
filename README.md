## Technologies Used

In the construction of this portfolio website, various technologies
were utilized to ensure robustness, efficiency, and a great user experience.
Below is a brief overview of these
technologies:

### Node.js

- **Usage**: Powers the back-end of the portfolio, handling server-side logic
  and requests.
- **Benefits**: Provides a fast, scalable, and efficient runtime environment.

### Express.js

- **Usage**: Used for routing and handling middleware.
- **Benefits**: Simplifies the server creation process, making it easier to
  write secure, modular, and fast
  applications.

### EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)

- **Usage**: Utilized for generating the HTML markup for the website.
- **Benefits**: Allows for the use of reusable templates and partials, improving
  maintainability and consistency across
  the website.

### Bootstrap 5

- **Usage**: Used for styling and designing responsive and aesthetically
  pleasing user interfaces.
- **Benefits**: Accelerates the development process, ensuring the website is
  mobile-friendly and accessible across
  various devices and screen sizes.

### md-block Markdown Library

- **Usage**: Employed for writing and formatting the textual parts of the
  website and other documentation. For mostly
  textual content, Markdown is more easy and efficient than HTML.
- **Benefits**: Enhances readability and presentation of documentation, allowing
  for ease of maintenance and
  modification.
- **Drawbacks**: The md-block library runs on client-side. It renders the
  Markdown content by doing the conversion on
  the client-side. This will appear slow to the user. A future improvement would
  be to use a server-side Markdown
  library, and render the content on the server-side.

### TypeScript

- **Usage**: Chosen over JavaScript for the development of the website.
- **Benefits**: Offers stronger type checking, reducing runtime errors and
  enhancing code quality and understandability.

Through the integration of these technologies, the portfolio website stands as a
testament to technical proficiency and a commitment to high-quality web 
development standards.
